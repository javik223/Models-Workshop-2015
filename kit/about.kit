                    <p>
                       The Models Workshop Project is a training, empowerment, enlightenment and nurturing platform for aspiring models on the ethics and business of modeling.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Models Workshop aims to broaden the scope and knowledge of the aspiring model, with the pre-requisite skills needed to be a top model. The Models Workshop is a platform for learning, practice, expression and networking.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Models Workshop is a springboard for upcoming models to undergo coaching/mentoring classes with emphasis on experiential knowledge to put them in the right direction to succeed in their modeling careers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Workshop features prominent international speakers and industry leaders, spanning the photographic, top-modeling, brand and design, skin therapy, fashion, makeup and stylistic industries.

                        We are proud to have had respected speakers like: Eloho Aisien, Reze Bonna, Lola Maja, Joan Okorodudu, Uti Nwachukwu, Ovo Ogufere and Sola Oyebade.
